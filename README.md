# OOP-Project

## 🤖 Mission

Welcome to our new Open-Space Office! 🏢

We have a dynamic work environment with 6 tables, each equipped with 4 seats.

We've developed a daily seat assignment program to promote camaraderie among new team members and encourage collaboration.

## 📜 Description

The seat reassignment program aims to achieve the following goals:

- **Promote Interaction:** 🔄 By rotating seats daily, colleagues get the chance to work alongside different team members, fostering new relationships and collaborations.

- **Encourage Team Bonding:** 🤗 Daily interactions in close proximity enable colleagues to build rapport, share knowledge, and learn from each other's expertise.

- **Facilitate Adaptability:** 🌟 Adapting to new seating arrangements daily enhances adaptability and flexibility within the team, crucial for agile teamwork.

- **Enhance Office Dynamics:** 🌈 Creating a dynamic seating arrangement promotes a vibrant office culture where ideas flow freely and creativity thrives.
